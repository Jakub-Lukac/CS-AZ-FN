## Project Overview
Demo to showcase how to connect Azure `Time Trigger Function` with `Event Hub Trigger` Function. To authenticate the function we use `Environment variables` from Azure Portal, which are also stored in a key vault. The Time Trigger function was designed to handle any time of traffic (small, big data) by implementing event hub batches.
